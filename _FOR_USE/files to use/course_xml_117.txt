I'm John. I created PHP 101. Let me tell you a little about the course and what you can expect to learn. I've been doing web development for about 12 years now. And, when I first started learning PHP (back in the dark ages of the web) sites like YouTube and SkillShare didn't even exist. So, there weren't a ton of really great tutorials. And, I really struggled.So, I got PHP figured out... I decided to turn around and help others. And, PHP 101 was born.Now, this course is aimed at beginners. We start with basic syntax and a simple Hello World script. And, my aim is to really break down what's going so you don't just understand WHAT to do, but WHY. I think that's so critical. To me, it's not enough to know what to type... you need to know when to, when NOT to, why... all of that. That said, we do get pretty fancy by the end. We get into MySQL database, PDO, prepared statements, writing a class, and more. Along the way we'll send emails. upload files, create folders, build a contact form, build a multi-page form use PHP sessions, submit form data to a database and whole lot more. And, I labor to make sure you understand every bit of code.This class is perfect for you if you're brand new to PHP and you want to go beyond just knowing what to code and really dig into the WHY; to free you up to be creative, tackle your own scrips in your own way and just make you supremely confident in what you're doing. That's my goal for you.Anyway, I'd love to have you as a student. So, let's get started shall we?</description>undefined<image>https://static.skillshare.com/uploads/video/thumbnails/85eaec7edc9664c09f24c5099a9771f7/448-252</image>undefined<provider>
