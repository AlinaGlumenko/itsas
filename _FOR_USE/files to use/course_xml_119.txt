Are you discouraged by long, multi-hour Python courses that don’t really seem to teach you what you really need to know or watched dozens of Youtube tutorials only to be more confused than before?My name is Jorge Escobar and I have worked in some of the top tech companies in the world, from Yahoo! to  MongoDB to PayPal, and now I’ve started my own educational project, FromZero, where I have helped thousands of students to kickstart their coding career.Python is a beautiful and complex language. But the truth is you don’t need to learn all of it to start building applications. And this is what this course is about.In about two hours I will teach you the essential parts of Python that you need to know to start using web frameworks, data science or artificial intelligence.But don’t be fooled, we’re not cutting corners in this course. It is packed full of really complex stuff, but taught in a way that you will understand, even without having coded anything before. Best of all, you don’t even need to have a computer. You will have the option to use a cloud-based Python development environment, so that you can practice at work or in a cyber cafe where you can pick up where you left off. This course is so good, I even recommend it to people that have been already coding in Python for a while, as it will clear a lot of those quirky things that you always wondered about. So, you have officially run out of excuses. You don’t need to know anything to take this course, no math, no computer knowledge. We will start by learning about variables, strings, lists, loops and conditionals, then move on to functions, object oriented programming with classes and objects, modules and packages and round it all up with an introduction to unit testing. The course has easy to follow and digestible video lessons as well as links to the code as we develop it. You can also purchase an eBook with all the material. The course can take anywhere from 3 to 7 days to complete based on how much material the student completes daily. Additionally we’re constantly updating the course, adding contents thanks to the feedback of our students. Join this course and start your path to becoming a professional Python developer! </description>undefined<image>https://static.skillshare.com/uploads/video/thumbnails/5991521115001/448-252</image>undefined<provider>
