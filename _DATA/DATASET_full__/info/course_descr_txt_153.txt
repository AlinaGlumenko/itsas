*** IMPORTANT UPDATE ***

When following along with this course we will be downloading Bootstrap (lecture 2), a Bootstrap blog template (lecture 11) and WordPress (lecture 16).

From time to time the contents of the downloads can change and you may notice a slight difference between versions. If you are having trouble with a later version or would prefer to use the same versions as I am in the videos, i have included all 3 in the download section of the project area.

If not follow along with the course as usual!
