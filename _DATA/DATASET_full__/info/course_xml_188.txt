I believe however that technology and it's theory are for everyone. So I designed this course to teach each topic in a variety of easy to digest ways. Through these multiple reinforcing steps, I believe anyone can follow along and succeed! Why is the Theory of Programming Important? Understanding Computer Science theory is what sets the Great programmers from the average ones. Programming theory is something that transcends a single programming language. It gives you skills and techniques you can apply to any programming language you touch. Learning the theory behind programming is just as important, if not more important than learning a singular programming language like Java or C++.Programming is all about problem solving. Analyzing a problem, and being able to figure out a way that a computer can help with that problem. Computer Science is the practice of this analysis process. It goes over the techniques and knowledge necessary to design efficient and sustainable code. In this lesson we will be covering: </description>undefined<image>https://static.skillshare.com/uploads/video/thumbnails/a031cf7d3824638b5c72833d31f4d365/448-252</image>undefined<provider>
