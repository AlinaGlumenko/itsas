in this class we’re gonna learn how to supercharge your CSS development using Sass.

Sass is a preprocessor scripting language that is interpreted or compiled into CSS. 

It’s essentially a programming language that allows us to write CSS with programming features like variables, nesting and calculations.

Of course, before taking this class, you should already be familiar with CSS but if you’ve been using CSS for a while, you’ve probably come up against a few situations where you find yourself writing ridiculously long selectors or forgetting the hex or rgba code of a color you’ve been using throughout your web page.

These are just a few of the issues that Sass helps us to solve and trust me, once you start using Sass you won’t want to go back to the old way of writing CSS.

So, as the title suggests, this class is going to be all about improving your CSS development workflow with Sass. 

We’ll look at how Sass works and then we’ll start using it, refactoring existing CSS code to use some of the best features of Sass.
