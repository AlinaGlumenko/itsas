I LOVE finding ways to speed up or automate my work. So I'm very excited to introduce you to Emmet, a plugin that enables you to write code FASTER.

What you will need:

Emmet is available in most web editors. Adobe Dreamweaver, Brackets, Sublime Text etc. 

For this class, I'll be demonstrating Emmet using an online web editor I use on a daily basis - Codepen.

Who should take this class:

This class is aimed at people who already have some basic knowledge of HTML. It is a beginners class, that will help you become a more efficient developer.
