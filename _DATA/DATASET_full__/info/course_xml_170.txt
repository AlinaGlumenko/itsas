Students will learn the industry-standard and will follow best practices for API architectures.If you already know the basics of Flask and you are interested in how to design, architect and build an API platform, this is the course for you.The course is divided in 2 sections:Introduction which covers all the concepts necessary to understand what is a RESTful API and its six constraints A step by step explanation building a Pet Store API that will include an authentication layer, a Store endpoint and a Pet endpoint as well as search functionalities The course has more than 5 hours of video tutorials as well as the source code at the end of each section, so that you can follow along with the coding process.The course can take anywhere from 3 to 10 days to complete based on how much material the student completes daily. Additionally we’re constantly updating the course, adding contents thanks to the feedback of our students.
