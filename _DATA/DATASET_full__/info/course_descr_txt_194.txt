AOA students,

In this CLI (command line Interface) for absolute beginners course, you will learn how to use the terminal on any Linux or Unix based machines. I'll be using a Windows PC or laptop, do not worry! they'll work the same for all Operating Systems (OS's).

In this course, we will learn what the command line is and why is it useful to us. We'll be learning about how to navigate the filesystem / our Computer, file manipulation, and much more.

If you complete this course by practicing along, by the end of this course, you'll never find this CLI daunting or scary EVER!!!.
