I have carefully constructed it follow follow a logical progression, where we start with the most fundamentals questions and ideas which any new programmer should be familiar with: What is a program? How to Computers understand our programs?How do we write Java programs?After a brief period answering those questions, we will dive straight into practical lessons on how to use Java to build programs the right way. Instead of just copy and pasting jargon filled text from external sources like many other courses do, I actually take the time to teach you how Java works under the hood! This means using tools like the Debugger to actually see what the memory space of a running Java program looks likes. Make no mistake, it is critically important to understand these points, and I have done my best to teach them in a way which actually makes sense (i.e. less jargon, more hands on examples).Once you are used to the basic tools and features of the Java programming language, we will get into deeper waters with basic and advanced usage of Object Oriented Programming, and a comprehensive, yet simple introduction to Software Architecture. For example, even many intermediate developers are not familiar with when exactly to: Use an Abstract Class versus an Interface Test your code Follow a software architecture I really cannot stress this enough: Forget what you know about learning to code. Instead of just adding to your confusion by explaining technical jargon with... technical jargon, I will actually present new ideas with simple to understand analogies amp; practical examples. Demo Source Code for each lesson available here.Desktop Sudoku Java Application available here.</description>undefined<image>https://static.skillshare.com/uploads/video/thumbnails/15b2091a826f41ff9fe11f932ab0a2e7/448-252</image>undefined<provider>
