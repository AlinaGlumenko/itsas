This course is aimed to teach university or school students the basics of JavaScript, anyone can take this course if they want to get a good grasp of JavaScript Fundamentals. This course is awesome because it was created with the help of a friend of mine teaching at university and all the exercises in this course are the questions that came in university's exams. And i promise you that at the end of this course you'll be comfortable programming with JavaScript.
