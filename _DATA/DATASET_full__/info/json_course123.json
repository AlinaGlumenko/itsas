There's two versions: 1) a simple non-database version we'll create first to quickly over all the base concepts. Then 2) we'll convert that into full-fledged database-driven login script complete with:Secure, session-based user access User registration Remember me feature Email-based password reset Cryptographically secure tokens SQL injection prevention Install script And more. FAIR WARNING This is an advanced course. The topics covered here assume a certain level of PHP knowledge. It's frankly only a small percentage of developers in the world who know how to do this properly. I strongly recommend you take my PHP 101 course BEFORE taking this one. Only jump into this when you're ready to challenge yourself and take your PHP skills up a notch. Comes with full source code in the Class Project section.","image":"https://static.skillshare.com/uploads/video/thumbnails/926147dfa71a123b5b9acb684406bcd4/448-252","provider":{"name":"Skillshare","sameAs":"https://www.skillshare.com","logo":"https://static.skillshare.com/assets/images/hands_logo_2x.png","type":"Organizationundefined","__text":"undefined"},"author":{"name":"John Morris","sameAs":"https://www.skillshare.com/user/johnmorris","image":"https://static.skillshare.com/uploads/users/9850108/user-image-medium.jpg?304769841","type":"Personundefined","__text":"undefined\nundefined\nundefined\nundefined"},"type":"Courseundefined","__text":"undefined\nundefined\nundefined\nundefined\nundefined\nundefined"}}
