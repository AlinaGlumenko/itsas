It&#039;s an isometric war game with persistent world map with Interwar era aesthetics, where everything from the frontline fighting to the back line logistics is made by players, each controlling a single soldier. &gt;Cool, how do I play with you guys? We are playing wardens, the blue faction, in opposition to the reddit green collies. &gt;How do I found you in game? We are usually in squads called vermin or \/v\/ermin because that was the board that started the group. &gt;Do we have a discord? We don&#039;t have any official discord since we hate that gay shit, and any one who claim otherwise is a falseflagger collie shitposter. No one stops you from using one with your friends tho, but keep that to yourself. &gt;Do I have to play with other people? Can I go solo? The game is designed to be better experienced with team cooperation. It is possible, though, to go about your own way helping in the war effort, just be advised that you would not do much like that, and will experience a really long grinding if you do. Also, some clans are very possessive of the stuff they make, and you won&#039;t be able to use it unless you join them. &gt;Is it a noob-friendly game? Most people in the game are willing to help newbies out, and there are plenty tutorials in wikia and youtube too. In a day or two you will know most if not all the basics. &gt;Do I need a mic to play? It is not necessary to have a mic, but be advised that many people don&#039;t read the chat, especially when they are busy with fighting or doing certain logistics stuff, so it is better if you scream them in mic &gt;Nobody answer me in the chat or mic, what the hell? People might be too busy or you are using the wrong in-game channels, there are squad, local, and world channels &gt;I can&#039;t see shit on my map, is this thing broken? The map of the game uses an intel system that only can be accessed and updated once you interact with a garrison base, or have a radio Previous: &gt;&gt;306409595"},"307561934":{"date":1600476857,"file":"1600357876528.png","r":98,"i":35,"lr":{"id":307561934},"b":101,"author":"Anonymous","imgurl":"1600476857391","tn_w":112,"tn_h":200,"sub":"Artificial Academy 2 General \/aa2g\/","teaser":"Artificial Academy 2 General \/aa2g\/ #1184 Devils May Cry Edition Welcome, this general is for the discussion of ILLUSION&#039;s Artificial Academy 2.

Use \/do or \/say if you want a DnD roleplay feeling. - First response to story is GPT-2. Don&#039;t put much effort into your *first* input. - Write &quot;you attempt to&quot; to make the outcome of an action uncertain and add RNG. - Griffin is good. Dragon is better (but only worth it if you play AIDG on the regular). - Coomers need to *manually* turn on the NSFW toggle for each adventure\/scenario. - Use \/remember and World Info to maintain continuity and permanence in stories. - Putting what your personality is like in \/remember will make you act more natural, example: &quot;You&#039;re a carefree shameless guy&quot;. - Many of the issues with loops and AI *can* be caused by improper use of \/remember, world info and clunky formatting\/grammar. - AI Dungeon is updated live and intermittently so always back up stories you are fond of as you MAY LOSE currently active adventures. - Clover Edition and others like it are outdated, so stop asking if you should use it."},"307712607":{"date":1600616228,"file":"dc782c6f7e962d7c8e8c978b997434e5.jpg","r":2,"i":0,"lr":{"id":307712607},"b":109,"author":"Anonymous","imgurl":"1600616228443","tn_w":141,"tn_h":200,"sub":"\/fgoalter\/ - Fate\/Grand Order NA General","teaser":"Previous: &gt;&gt;307702349 &gt;Battle in New York 2020 2020-09-14 01:00 - 09-29 20:59 PDT https:\/\/webview.fate-go.us\/2020\/0910_bny2020\/ &gt;Battle in New York 2020 Pickup Summon 2020-09-14 01:00 - 09-29 20:59 PDT https:\/\/webview.fate-go.us\/2020\/0910_bny2020_pu\/ &gt;Shuten-Douji Rank Up Quest Commemorative Pickup Summon (Daily) 2020-09-06 21:00 - 09-20 20:59 PDT https:\/\/webview.fate-go.us\/2020\/0907_shutendouji_reinforcement_pu\/ &gt;[News] https:\/\/webview.fate-go.us\/ &gt;[Servant Info] Simulator:http:\/\/fgosimulator.webcrow.jp\/ Servant Planner:https:\/\/docs.google.com\/spreadsheets\/d\/1CfEa5k-sB5btC8905kZKPfRC07IokKM1sXnoXo6-YQo Servant Strengthening and Interlude Timeline:https:\/\/kazemai.github.io\/fgo-vz\/relate_quest.html Damage Calculator:https:\/\/docs.google.com\/spreadsheets\/d\/1CWsaeirsiQHCLf2OJ15kbZSvFlRRdUl5czWXBzSebyg\/ Command Card Statistics:https:\/\/files.catbox.moe\/rv66ol.txt &gt;[Mats\/Summoning Info] Rateups in FGO JP:https:\/\/files.catbox.moe\/wap17s.png  Upcoming event items:https:\/\/docs.google.com\/spreadsheets\/d\/1m-h4CIUOKaJRAmfTAhoDdmwVAzAzyM70cITRb36Y96M\/ Drop rates:https:\/\/docs.google.com\/spreadsheets\/d\/1_SlTjrVRTgHgfS7sRqx4CeJMqlz687HdSlYqiW-JvQA Quartz in 2020 and 2021:https:\/\/docs.google.com\/spreadsheets\/d\/e\/2PACX-1vRQFC6pgsvDr11c1oe8PcGXurF3uw0MBq73YoQMGCJemzMics9LfwVurTLMi0rpfHNEBjG6gVCOrIer\/pubhtml#"},"307401639":{"date":1600359732,"file":"lindyxbow.png","r":374,"i":70,"lr":{"id":307401639},"b":110,"author":"Anonymous","imgurl":"1600359732163","tn_w":200,"tn_h":177,"sub":"\/mbg\/ - Mount and Blade General","teaser":"Crossbow Edition (Looted): &gt;&gt;306649593 READ THE PASTEBIN BEFORE ASKING QUESTIONS Beta e1.5.1: https:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/games\/261550\/announcements\/detail\/2882822214124259601 Modding tools announced: https:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/newshub\/app\/261550\/view\/4641476065441186376 BANNERLORD Pastebin: https:\/\/pastebin.com\/tAvcAbpT (embed) (embed) (embed) &gt;How do I get a custom banner? https:\/\/bannerlord.party\/banner\/ The Banner maker tool generates a code that you copy and you Ctrl+V into the game while in the banner editor.

Always carry healing supplies. Building an outpost will attract trader caravans and hostile raids. Building one too early might be more than you can handle. Pressing F1 will open the tutorial screen. Mousing over the stats screen and HUD will reveal useful tooltips and additional info. Before asking questions, consider if you can easily answer them yourself. Learning and exploring is a big part of the game.

Always carry healing supplies. Building an outpost will attract trader caravans and hostile raids. Building one too early might be more than you can handle. Pressing F1 will open the tutorial screen. Mousing over the stats screen and HUD will reveal useful tooltips and additional info. Before asking questions, consider if you can easily answer them yourself. Learning and exploring is a big part of the game.
