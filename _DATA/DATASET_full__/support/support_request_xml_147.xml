  <message>Hello everyone, I wanted to post something in courses today and everytime I click on the topic it says, " Welcome back Ps4isthefuture please log in to post". Well I was logged in before clicking on the topic, then it logs me out. I looked at my permissions for my profile and everything looked ok to me. But maybe the issue is somewhere else. I tried in both FF and IE. Thank you.</message>
