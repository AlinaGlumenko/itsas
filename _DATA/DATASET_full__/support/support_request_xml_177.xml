  <message>Please add some payment option(s) for the Big Box License that do not require a credit card. In Germany those things are used very little (if i said i could use a CC like once every 3 years, that would be overstating things), they cost a yearly fee and i'm not willing to pay that or sign any contracts, i also don't like the idea of them checking my SCHUFA status just so i can buy a piece of software online (not that there is anything wrong with that, i just don't like the idea of people digging through my data for what should be a simple transaction).</message>
