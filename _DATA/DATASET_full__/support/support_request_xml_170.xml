  <message>I often find myself in threads where all the posters are simply commenting on the OP and asking for more, etc. In amongst these posts, OP will often post some more images and information, which I can only find by going through every page of the thread.I think a post filter feature should be employed so that people don't have to scroll through posts that they don't need to read, and can find a select few posted by a specified forum member.</message>
