  <message>I'm trying to upload a measly 12 MB file as an attachment, and Firefox uses up all my RAM(2GB), and eventually freezes. I ended all unnecessary exes (like explorer.exe) and closed everything and tried again. the uploading window appeared, so I went to read for an hour, and when I got back, it was still uploading. I messed with firefox, and it just crashed. I eventually tried it with internet explorer, and failed again.</message>
