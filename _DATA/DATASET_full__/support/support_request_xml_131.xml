  <message> I can't download coursesf ! I gave my email address, received a mail with a link, but unfortunately leading me to an unavailable file/page. Asked a second link with providing my email address again, received a different link, but no way, still unavailable... Tried the links in both FireFox (latest) and IE11, same issue.</message>
