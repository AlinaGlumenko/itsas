  <message>I've looked at image uploads which have the following property and would love to know how it's done. "https://www.courses.com/wp-content/sp-resources/forum-image-" And any help with how to use the upload attachments feature would be most welcome too. I'm all at sea with this. Been using Imgur, but don't like how it puts a link to it's site on.</message>
