"message" : "Heya, I was wondering if there is a feature, to possibly delete updates which accumilate in the updates folder? I have around 3.5gb of update files accumalated over the last few months, and think this is way too much. There should be a feature which gives us the abililty to choose wether or not to delete them automatically and immediatley after install. Or to choose automatically but after a few weeks, a month or two months, or something like that."
