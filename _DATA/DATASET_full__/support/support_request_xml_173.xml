  <message>when navigating the courses, either browsing through topics or through my own CP, the board randomly logs me out. I say randomly because I can't find a pattern like "period of inactivity" or whatever that would cause these logouts. Either way, having to login every time I want to perform a board related action is kind of annoying.</message>
