  <message>I was trying to replace the screenshots on one of my course (I actually noticed them missing on the course). When I upload them, they appear to be uploading right, but when I click on Save and the new post screen is loaded, there are no screen shots??? I have tried jpg, png. Never had any problems before.  Also tried a couple browsers with same results</message>
