  <message>I think that it would be wise to have a list of forbidden characters near the Invitation to Add A New course. I would also love to see the ability to withdraw changes you've made in error in the Changes Status section. Lastly, I would love it if there was a way to search within a single theme without using the Add A New course workaround.</message>
