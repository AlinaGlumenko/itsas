  <message>The forums default theme has now been set to Invaders and it's not too distracting for most views. However, the All Activity view is now see-through and confusing, especially as this view is text based and needs a solid background. Is there any chance that this can be addressed, or else the original Dark theme can once again be made the default?</message>
