  <message>Well i have just come on to the forums this morning to find it absolutely full up with spam on the activity feed. 4 or 5 different new users had flooded the feed with spam. If any users ever see this stuff before a moderator removes it can you please use the report button on the users thread or profile page. That way the moderators will receive a notification and a email about it and it wont sit there filling the feed for very long.</message>
