In that course, I used this Sudoku Application as a teaching tool in order to explain how to design, architect, and build Java Desktop Applications. It is highly practical in nature, and the idea is that you follow along in your own IDE with me. Even if there are concepts which do not make immediate sense to you, it is helpful to follow along. Once you are ready to learn about each topic in detail, check out the course.","image":"https://static.skillshare.com/uploads/video/thumbnails/6167873374001/448-252","provider":{"name":"Skillshare","sameAs":"https://www.skillshare.com","logo":"https://static.skillshare.com/assets/images/hands_logo_2x.png","type":"Organizationundefined","__text":"undefined"},"author":{"name":"Ryan Kay","sameAs":"https://www.skillshare.com/user/wiseass","image":"https://static.skillshare.com/uploads/users/532815216/user-image-medium.png?1851606530","type":"Personundefined","__text":"undefined\nundefined\nundefined\nundefined"},"type":"Courseundefined","__text":"undefined\nundefined\nundefined\nundefined\nundefined\nundefined"}}
