  <message>Purchased a course  through Amazon, as I figured it would be quicker than digging my wallet out and jazz, and the email on my amazon account is registered under my wifes name. When I log in, it shows 'Licensed to WifesName'.  can I have that  corrected? Even having it removed from view would be terrific.</message>
