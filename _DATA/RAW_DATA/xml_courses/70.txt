There's two versions: 1) a simple non-database version we'll create first to quickly over all the base concepts. Then 2) we'll convert that into full-fledged database-driven login script complete with:Secure, session-based user access User registration Remember me feature Email-based password reset Cryptographically secure tokens SQL injection prevention Install script And more. FAIR WARNING This is an advanced course. The topics covered here assume a certain level of PHP knowledge. It's frankly only a small percentage of developers in the world who know how to do this properly. I strongly recommend you take my PHP 101 course BEFORE taking this one. Only jump into this when you're ready to challenge yourself and take your PHP skills up a notch. Comes with full source code in the Class Project section.</description>undefined<image>https://static.skillshare.com/uploads/video/thumbnails/926147dfa71a123b5b9acb684406bcd4/448-252</image>undefined<provider>
