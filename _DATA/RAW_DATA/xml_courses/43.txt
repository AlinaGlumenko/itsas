I've helped over 45,000 students around the world learn this fun and fantastic programming language, JavaScript Are you looking for a thorough course to learn JavaScript?Welp.. that's this course! Over 8 hours of video.If you have some prior JavaScript experience, this course is still for you due to how thorough it is.Plus the projects that come with this course are very practical and really help you use what you've learned.Here's what you'll be learning in this course/In this JavaScript for Beginners course you will learn everything you need to become a confident JavaScript developer. Some courses only teach you the programming side of JavaScript, and other courses only show you the interactive side of JavaScript. But the truth is: JavaScript is an interactive programming language and you need to know both sides of JavaScript.JavaScript fundamentals - You'll learn how to write JavaScript, where it's applied, and how to execute it. We'll be looking at JavaScript syntax (the funny looking curly brackets). We'll also look at ways to easily debug your JavaScript code so you aren't wasting your valuable time staring at broken code.Variables - A variable is a tiny piece of memory that's allocated in your computer. It's used for storing a tiny piece of data, like your name, a number, or several lines of code it should execute.Web page interactivity - The #1 reason why JavaScript is so popular is because of its ability to interact with a web page. You'll learn how to accept user input, change what your page looks like, and take an action based on the users action. This is what make websites truly interactive.Data types &amp; data structures - Unlike other courses, in this JavaScript for Beginners course you'll learn the different data types and how to use them. You'll learn about numbers, strings, floats, functions, objects, undefined, null and more... and why they are important to know.Conditional statements - These are the little checkpoints in a program that make a computer actually do something. For example, if you're 18 or older you're allowed to vote. This is a real life conditional statement. It reads like this: if age > 18: do something. This is exactly how computers know what to do and you'll learn how to write these.Functions - When you write enough code you'll eventually end up copying and pasting the exact same code over and over again. A function lets you write a piece of code one time and use it over and over. You'll learn about regular functions, immediately invoked functioned, anonymous functions and arrow functions!Loops - One of the most powerful concepts in computer science is the idea of a loop. Basically it lets you do one action over and over again until it's told to stop. You'll learn about for loop, foreach loops and while loops!JavaScript quirks - JavaScript has some strange functionality that other programming languages don't have. We'll cover several quirks together in this course and you'll learn about things like hoisting, closures, promises, and block scoping.Objects, Classes and OOP - In JavaScript there's a special data type called an object. It lets you store named data points for easy access along with functions. In modern JavaScript we can write a class, much like other languages such as Python. Classes are a nicer way to write JavaScript objects. You can extend them, over write pieces of them, and re-use entire chunks of code — they're like functions but much bigger. And you'll learn all about these!API's and Ajax requests - API's are inevitable in web development. It's important to know how they theoretically work, and how to work with them. You'll get hands on experience with a real life API and an Ajax request.Are you ready to start writing JavaScript?If not.. consider this: I have a couple other JavaScript courses with over 45,000 students and over 2,000 reviews in total! Here are a few real reviews from my other JavaScript courses:— I've been trying to lean Javascript for a few months now. This course is helping everything fall into place.— I really like and appreciate this tutor for his way of explaining. Fantastic!— Not completed the course just yet, but from the lessons so far I have found Kalob's explanations to be clear and succinct. He explains exactly what he is doing and why. The pace is spot on and I never felt the explanations were verbose. I've never had the most confidence with Js so I decided to buy this course. I feel the lessons are helping and I am slowly gaining in confidence by the day. Great for beginners.— Its amazing, the explanation is so simple, I wish I had gone through this course earlier.— Yes, so far its been very easy and has a great start.— IT'S A GREAT JS BEGINNER COURSEI've been teaching JavaScript for several years, helped thousands of people learn to read, write and understand JavaScript — and I've put 3x more effort into developing this course than all my previous JavaScript courses. I promise you will enjoy it! See you inside!</description>undefined<image>https://static.skillshare.com/uploads/video/thumbnails/0ab63be061d2a2051fc5a20337d2bc7f/448-252</image>undefined<provider>
