Hi, I'm Dan and in this free short-course we'll quickly go through all the basics to creating a simple responsive website using Dreamweaver CC 2018. We'll look at responsive web design techniques, as well as making sure you understand exactly what you're doing. We'll make the most of the most up to date web techniques, using HTML5 and CSS3 to present the best site possible. We'll use Media queries to manipulate the sites styling at different widths to give our site responsiveness. 

I built this course for the super-newbies. I've even got fail-safe exercise files so you can never fall behind. This would be the perfect starting point for anyone that wants to dip their toes into building responsive websites. We'll make 3 different responsive points, desktop, tablet and mobile. 

We'll start with defining the site in Dreamweaver. I'll give you a basic starting point of the site to get the ball rolling, then we'll preview our site and improve the responsiveness.
