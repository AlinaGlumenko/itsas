In this class, I take you through my basic process for Test Driven Development on Android, using Kotlin. Please note that I am deliberately trying to keep my explanations and lessons simple and practical, as I dislike the annoying jargon which permeates discussion of Testing and TDD.

I also discuss best practices for:

Creating a testable architecture
Testing with suspend functions and launch coroutines
How to create test doubles without any libraries
How to organize a single entry point to test all Units in a class
Plenty of discussion on implementing Coroutines on Android
