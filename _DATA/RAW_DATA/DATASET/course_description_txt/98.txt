I have been teaching UI Design from the past 3 years and I have seen a lot of people getting and running after Pretty Interfaces and Pretty Designs rather than looking at the overall picture

The Basic Understanding of all the elements you can use in your design is necessary to become a great UI Visual Designer. Also most Designer don't know the basic Principles of Design and how they apply in latest UI Design and Web Design

Things you will learn with examples in this Class are

Focal Point of Design
