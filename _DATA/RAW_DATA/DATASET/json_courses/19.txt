                                    Learn how to create a beautiful and flexible portfolio web page. This web page is a a large "card" style and is designed to look great and help direct people to your other portfolio places such as Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, GitHub and more. 
To get the most out of this course...You should already know some basic HTML and CSS. You don't need to be an expert but you'll need to know how to create links, copy/paste SVG's and use CSS classes. 
We'll start by creating a web page template, then we'll add the overall page structure, add some images for immediate gratification while we're working on this, and lastly we'll fill it in with content. 
As a bonus, we'll also install a little tooltip plugin as well to give our links a little extra "WOW" to them.
