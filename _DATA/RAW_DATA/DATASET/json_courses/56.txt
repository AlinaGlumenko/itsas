                                    This course is for someone who needs basic training in Linux, someone who is already in IT and wants to add a new skill.  It is specifically designed for those who have been really busy with their work and don't have enough time.  Now you don't have to stay awake at night or sneak out of your lunch break.  You will learn so many Linux commands in just 2 days.  Sounds unreal?  Well take a look at my syllabus and you see what I will be covering and then ask yourself if it is worth spending a couple of hours for only 2 days:
